This project is a school project, in this project we have a school system and we were asked to develop a school system.
This card was also asked to be spent in the canteen by loading money by the parent. We were asked to do all of these projects with windows form.
To provide all of these, there are 3 different project projects in the repository, respectively visual, visual phone app, visual student .


# Visual :
We designed this project to be used by the principal. After the login screen, the principal can add students, add teachers, and if he wants,
he can see information such as attendance tracking, which products are prohibited by the parents in the canteen, and how many times a product is purchased.

# Visual Student:
We made this application to show instead of a card, the student is accepted as having entered the school by selecting a certain date, and by selecting a certain date,
it looks like he/she has checked out.
